I added the workflow in so/bpmn/MSOInfrastructure/process folder, and the execution listener to the groovy folder in MSOInfrastructure. Then I recompiled the whole docker container by following the steps described on  http://onap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submodules/so.git/docs/Building_SO.html, and followed on the next topic which describes the docker containers' deployment procedure. I see 88 different WF on the cockpit, as should you (87 are ONAP's built in BPMN, the last one beeing my own). 

The rest end point gets exposed on its own. After logging on the cockpit if you try send a GET request on http://localhost:8080/camunda/api/engine/engine/default/process-definition/ you should get the list of WF deployed on your engine.
